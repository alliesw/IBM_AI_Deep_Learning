W6 Project: 
Build a computer vision app that you will deploy on the cloud through Code Engine. For the project, you will create a custom classifier, 
train it and test it on your own images.

> For the project in this module, you will develop a new custom classifier using one of the classification methods you learnt and then deploy it as 
a web app using Code Engine. There are various advantages to deploying your classifier. First, you can share your classifier with anyone in the 
world. They simply need to enter the URL of your model into any web browser. Second, you can showcase your web app in your portfolio and your 
potential future employers can interact with your project. For each class and its prediction, take screenshots of your test images and the 
predictions from Code Engine.
