Reduce the impact of noise or overfitting

Q2. Consider the tensor x and the neural network object model that uses dropout . How would you make a prediction after training ?
model.eval()
yhat=model(x)

Q3. Select the constructer value to let 40% of the  activations to the  shut off 
nn.Dropout(0.4)
